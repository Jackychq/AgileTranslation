A coaching conversation is not just small talk about how things are going or not going. Coaching conversations are for committed individuals or teams that want to make a significant change or get wiser about an important matter. To help you succeed as a coach, you can apply a structure to the coaching conversation. This helps you and the coachee(or team) to focus on the important topics and find specific actions to carry out as results of the conversation.
教练谈话并不仅仅是关于工作进展如何的简单交谈，而是为了帮助已经做出承诺的个体或者团队进行重大的改变，或者针对某项关键事务做出更加明智的选择。为了成为一名成功的教练，你可以应用一种结构化的教练谈话方法。作为对话的结果，它可以帮助你和被教练者（或者团队）聚焦于重要的话题，并找到具体的行动方案。

It is important to remember that a coaching conversation is something that you design together with the persons you are working with, at the moment when the conversation is wanted. As a coach you never take the coachee or team to places they do not want to go — this would be strictly out of line. You should never guide the content of the discussion, nor force somebody into a discussion. What you do instead is help them to go where they want to go, while helping them reflect on what is important.
重要的是要时刻铭记，在需要进行谈话的时候，教练对话是由你和与你一起工作的人们共同完成的。作为一名教练，你永远不要把被教练者或者团队带到他们不想去的地方-这是非常越界的行为。你永远不要引导讨论的内容，也不要强迫某些人参与讨论。相反，你要做的是帮助他们识别出什么是重要的，与此同时，帮助他们去到他们想去的地方。

As the coach, your task is to make sure that the environment is right. In sec. 3.4, we mentioned the important communication enablers. Try to ensure that all of them are in place. Allocating enough time and setting up a distraction-free environment is easy, but if there are large cultural differences or you lack a common language you may have to reconsider whether the conversation is worth having at all.
作为一名教练，你的任务是要确保环境的正确性。在第3.4节中，我们谈到重要的沟通要素，你要尽力确保所有要素都正常存在。分配足够的时间，创造一个没有干扰的环境是比较容易的，但是如果存在较大的文化差异，或者缺乏共同语言，你就需要重新考虑一下这样的谈话是不是有进行的价值了。

We have found that many people do not know what coaching looks like. Sometimes they just need to vent or want some advice and get upset when you start by asking questions. In such situations, we have found it useful to ask for permission to coach, for example, by saying: “Is it ok if I ask you some questions to help you achieve the result you want to achieve?”
我们发现很多人不清楚教练是什么样子的。有时候，他们仅仅需要发泄一下，或者寻求一些建议，当你开始询问问题的时候，他们就会变的心烦意乱。在这种情况下，我们发现寻求对教练的认可是非常有帮助的，比如，可以说：“我可以问你一些问题来帮助你达到你希望达到的目的吗？”

The two levels of the coaching conversation
教练谈话的两个层次

As shown below in fig. 3.3, a coaching conversation is conducted on two levels: A) the conversation level and B) the meta level (Storch et al., 2006). As the coach you are constantly acting on both levels. The coachee or team is primarily on the conversation level, but will from time to time be invited to the meta level by you.
如下图3.3所示，教练谈话可以划分成两个层次：A)会话层和B）抽象层(Storch et al., 2006)。作为教练，你需要不断的在两个层次之间切换，被教练者或者团队主要处于会话层，但是会时不时的被你带入抽象层。

The conversation level is where the actual conversation happens. Here you are using the levels of listening, showing curiosity and forming questions based on keywords as we discussed previously. The coachee or team are also on this level as they answer your questions.
会话层是实际谈话所处的层次。在这一层次中，你需要使用我们前面讨论的倾听的层次，表现好奇和通过关键词提出问题的技巧，被教练者或者团队也在这个层次中，因为他们要回答你的问题。

The meta level is where you are observing, reflecting and designing the conversation. Here you are deciding which powerful questions to ask, which hypotheses to formulate and in which direction to take the conversation next. As a coach, imagine yourself as having a third eye observing the conversation from the meta level and your awareness about the flow of the conversation. The answers you get will help you make the right decisions.
抽象层是你进行观察、反馈和引导谈话的层次。在这一层次中，你可以决定问哪些有力的问题，做出哪些假设，还有谈话向哪个方向发展。作为一名教练，想象你拥有第三只眼睛在抽象层观察着谈话和你对谈话进程的认知。你得到的答案将能够帮助你做出正确的决定。

Meet up at the meta level
在抽象层相遇

As mentioned, you will from time to time invite the coachee or team to join you at the meta level. The purpose for this is to have a conversation about the conversation to collaborate on designing the conversation, reflect on the learnings so far and make decisions about where to go next. There are normally at least three opportunities for meeting at the meta level:
  (1) When you are establishing a contract for the conversation
  (2) When you are having a check-up during the conversation
  (3) When you are concluding the conversation.

At the very start of the conversation, you should spend a little time on making contact with the one(s) you are coaching. Establishing contact helps people relax and feel confident in speaking freely. This is small talk and chit chat, talking about the weather, the traffic, how’s-your-family, etc. Keep in mind that you should start steering towards starting the actual coaching conversation before too long.

How you can establish the contract
When you are establishing the contract, you invite the other part to talk about the conversation you are about to have. The contract consists of an agreement that you will have a coaching conversation, the ground rules for the conversation and the goal for the conversation. First of all, it should be clear for both parties that you are not just having a little chat. You are about to enter a serious conversation which might include both sensitive information and personal decisions. This expectation is sometimes implicit in the invitation, but it doesn’t hurt to make it explicit. If you are in a discussion already and realize that it might turn into a coaching conversation, you might ask “Is it OK if I ask you some questions to help you solve this problem?” You can also set up a later meeting in a similar way: “Should we sit down tomorrow and have a coaching conversation about this topic?


You will also need to establish the ground rules of the coaching conversation. This normally includes a statement of confidentiality from your side as well as the promise of an “emergency exit” for the coachee or individual team members. For confidentiality, we typically use the simple and strict Vegas Rule that we described earlier, in sec. 3.1. However, if the team you are coaching is large and the atmosphere in the organization is sufficiently constructive, forgiving and supporting, you could also consider the Chatham House Rule4. It states that all participants are free to use any information, but are not allowed to reveal who made any comment.


In recurring meetings the rules quickly become implicit and you don’t need to repeat them, but when you are coaching someone for the first time you will have to explicitly set down the rules. We have a kind of boilerplate that we use that goes something like this:
  “Before we get started, I would like to make it clear that I will keep this conversation confidential. I may bring up general issues with others, but won’t talk about things that can be traced to you or to this discussion unless you give me permission. Also, you have the right to end the discussion and walk out if you feel like it, no questions asked. If at any point and for whatever reason you feel that you don’t want to be in this room anymore, just say so and we will stop right there.”

We find it good practice to have the counterpart formulate the goal of the conversation in one short sentence — and we usually also write it down in a notepad or on a sticky note. We usually ask questions like:
  • “What is the topic you want to elaborate and get insights on?”
  • “How can I best serve you during this conversation?”
  • “Are there questions you especially want me to ask or questions you absolutely do not want me to ask?”
  • “When this conversation is over, where do you expect to be and what do you hope to have learned?

Now the actual coaching conversation can begin. Start by picking out keywords from the goals you just agreed on and formulate a question or several questions from that.

Having check-ups
During the conversation, you should from time to time make a timeout to check-up on the conversation. Look at the clock and the timebox, summarize the learning so far and decide where to go next.

Check-ups help to co-design the conversation on the fly with the purpose of bringing the most possible value into it. Think of it as a sort of in-sprint inspect-and-adapt cycle on the meta level.

You can use check-ups when you feel the conversation is at a crossroads in which you have to decide which path to take next. Be humble and unbiased: do not take for granted that your personal decision will be the best path. Instead ask the one(s) you are coaching what they think and follow their choice. Remember: it is not about you! It is all about them! You can also use check-ups to re-negotiate the goal if you and the other person realize that another topic seems to be more important.

You can make as many check-ups as you feel necessary, asking questions like:
  •“Let me summarize the discussion so far. We have been discussing . . . and . . . , figuring out that . . . . Do you want to expand more on this, or would you rather move on and look at other options? What would that be?”
  • “Let’s look at where we are in this conversation. As I see it, we can either go in the direction of . . . or in the direction of . . . . You might see a third direction. Where do you want to go from here?”
  • “Let’s step out of the conversation and check how we are doing. In the beginning of this conversation we agreed to speak about . . . but it seems to me that we are now discussing . . . . What do you think, should we return to the original topic or is the new topic more important to you?

When the check-up is over you can continue the conversation taking into account the decisions you have just made together.

As an aside, we have found it useful to have a clock unobtrusively available. The simplest way is to put your wristwatch flat on the table beside your notepad. Smartwatches can be set to vibrate at certain points in time. Some smartphones can be configured to always show the time and there’s a plethora of timer apps. If all else fails, simply explain that you want to see how much time is left before you pull out your phone or watch.


Define the next steps, starting with a clear conclusion


By the end of the conversation, it is time to come to a conclusion focusing on the specific steps the coachee or team is going to do, in order to initiate the desired change. Have him, her or them summarize the conclusion instead of you doing it. That fosters the sense of responsibility. Remember: it is not your solution — it is their solution!

As a follow up to the conversation, it is great practice to ask about what the next step will be, when this will be done and how you will know that this has been achieved. To the last question the one(s) you coach will usually answer something like: “I’ll send you an e-mail, letting you know how it went”. In service to the other part, you could then reply: “And if I do not receive this mail, will it be helpful for you if I ask you about how it went?” This attitude sharpens the awareness about the coaching conversation as something that serves a purpose, rather than just being a chat about life, the universe and everything.

End by asking for feedback
Finally, being a coach that wants to improve your skills, you should also ask for feedback about the coaching conversation. You can ask questions like: “How was this conversation for you?”, “What did I do that was especially useful for you?” and “Which questions did I ask that were useless or disturbing for your understanding of the matter?”.

Receive the feedback with gratitude and ask clarifying questions if you wish, but do not go into arguing about whether the feedback was right or wrong. You are asking for opinions and everyone is entitled to their own. The important matter is how the coachee or team experienced your coaching — there is most likely a point behind the feedback regardless of whether you liked it or not.

Just like you opened the conversation, it can also be good to close down the conversation with chit chat and small talk as you collect your pens and papers and pack your bag. If you are meeting the coachee or the team again, you might also want to agree on the time and perhaps a topic or even an agenda for your next meeting.

Try this
1) Coaching conversations are best practiced in a live setup. We recommend that you start out by practicing with individuals and once you are comfortable with this, you can move on to coaching teams. This means finding someone who is willing to be coached by you, even though you may still be a novice.
Ideally the initial setup should be three persons: one who is coaching, one who is being coached (the coachee) and one who observes the conversation. This works very well if all three of you want to practice coaching. You can then take turns being the coach, the coachee and the observer. You can do 20-minute coaching conversations followed by five minutes of feedback from the observer, then take a five-minute break, switch roles and have a new coaching conversation. (Yes, as you probably already have figured out, the Pomodoro technique5 can be used for many purposes.)

2) If you can’t find an observer, then another option is to record the conversation and learn from it. You will of course need the permission of the coachee to record the conversation. Our experience tells us that while audio recordings are good, video recordings are much better for recall and understanding. Position the camera so that your upper body is in the frame, not the coachee. Make sure that the picture is wide enough for you to move around, but still shows your postures and facial expressions clearly.

Most modern pocket cameras or smartphones are more than adequate for this purpose, but you may want to record a minute of video beforehand to extrapolate whether there is enough memory available. Downscale the video to a lower quality in order to save space, as low-quality video is better than no video at all. A cheap tripod, a fast charger and a long charging cable will also be useful

3) Imagine a coaching conversation where you find it difficult to synchronize with the coachee. You can either think back to a previous coaching conversation that did not go as expected or think about an upcoming conversation with a person you are uncertain about. Now consider the communication enablers in sec. 3.4. Which ones were (or will be) especially relevant for the success of the conversation? Is there something related to the enablers that you could have done (or could now do) differently to improve the chances of success?
