# structure for a coaching conversation
# 教练谈话的结构

A coaching conversation is not just small talk about how things are going or not going. Coaching conversations are for committed individuals or teams that want to make a significant change or get wiser about an important matter. To help you succeed as a coach, you can apply a structure to the coaching conversation. This helps you and the coachee(or team) to focus on the important topics and find specific actions to carry out as results of the conversation.

教练谈话并不仅仅是关于工作进展如何的简单交谈，而是为了帮助已经做出承诺的个体或者团队进行重大的改变，或者针对某项关键事务做出更加明智的选择。为了成为一名成功的教练，你可以应用一种结构化的教练谈话方法。作为对话的结果，它可以帮助你和被教练者（或者团队）聚焦于重要的话题，并找到具体的行动方案。

It is important to remember that a coaching conversation is something that you design together with the persons you are working with, at the moment when the conversation is wanted. As a coach you never take the coachee or team to places they do not want to go — this would be strictly out of line. You should never guide the content of the discussion, nor force somebody into a discussion. What you do instead is help them to go where they want to go, while helping them reflect on what is important.

重要的是要时刻铭记，在需要进行谈话的时候，教练对话是由你和与你一起工作的人们共同完成的。作为一名教练，你永远不要把被教练者或者团队带到他们不想去的地方-这是非常越界的行为。你永远不要引导讨论的内容，也不要强迫某些人参与讨论。相反，你要做的是帮助他们识别出什么是重要的，与此同时，帮助他们去到他们想去的地方。

As the coach, your task is to make sure that the environment is right. In sec. 3.4, we mentioned the important communication enablers. Try to ensure that all of them are in place. Allocating enough time and setting up a distraction-free environment is easy, but if there are large cultural differences or you lack a common language you may have to reconsider whether the conversation is worth having at all.

作为一名教练，你的任务是要确保环境的正确性。在第3.4节中，我们谈到重要的沟通要素，你要尽力确保所有要素都正常存在。分配足够的时间，创造一个没有干扰的环境是比较容易的，但是如果存在较大的文化差异，或者缺乏共同语言，你就需要重新考虑一下这样的谈话是不是有进行的价值了。

We have found that many people do not know what coaching looks like. Sometimes they just need to vent or want some advice and get upset when you start by asking questions. In such situations, we have found it useful to ask for permission to coach, for example, by saying: “Is it ok if I ask you some questions to help you achieve the result you want to achieve?”

我们发现很多人不清楚教练是什么样子的。有时候，他们仅仅需要发泄一下，或者寻求一些建议，当你开始询问问题的时候，他们就会变的心烦意乱。在这种情况下，我们发现寻求对教练的认可是非常有帮助的，比如，可以说：“我可以问你一些问题来帮助你达到你希望达到的目的吗？”

## The two levels of the coaching conversation
## 教练谈话的两个层次

As shown below in fig. 3.3, a coaching conversation is conducted on two levels: A) the conversation level and B) the meta level (Storch et al., 2006). As the coach you are constantly acting on both levels. The coachee or team is primarily on the conversation level, but will from time to time be invited to the meta level by you.

如下图3.3所示，教练谈话可以划分成两个层次：A)会话层和B）抽象层(Storch et al., 2006)。作为教练，你需要不断的在两个层次之间切换，被教练者或者团队主要处于会话层，但是会时不时的被你带入抽象层。

The conversation level is where the actual conversation happens. Here you are using the levels of listening, showing curiosity and forming questions based on keywords as we discussed previously. The coachee or team are also on this level as they answer your questions.

会话层是实际谈话所处的层次。在这一层次中，你需要使用我们前面讨论的倾听的层次，表现好奇和通过关键词提出问题的技巧，被教练者或者团队也在这个层次中，因为他们要回答你的问题。

The meta level is where you are observing, reflecting and designing the conversation. Here you are deciding which powerful questions to ask, which hypotheses to formulate and in which direction to take the conversation next. As a coach, imagine yourself as having a third eye observing the conversation from the meta level and your awareness about the flow of the conversation. The answers you get will help you make the right decisions.
抽象层是你进行观察、反馈和引导谈话的层次。在这一层次中，你可以决定问哪些有力的问题，做出哪些假设，还有谈话向哪个方向发展。作为一名教练，想象你拥有第三只眼睛在抽象层观察着谈话和你对谈话进程的认知。你得到的答案将能够帮助你做出正确的决定。

## Meet up at the meta level
## 在抽象层相遇

As mentioned, you will from time to time invite the coachee or team to join you at the meta level. The purpose for this is to have a conversation about the conversation to collaborate on designing the conversation, reflect on the learnings so far and make decisions about where to go next. There are normally at least three opportunities for meeting at the meta level:
  (1) When you are establishing a contract for the conversation
  (2) When you are having a check-up during the conversation
  (3) When you are concluding the conversation.

如上文所述，你会时不时的把被教练者或者团队带入抽象层。这么做的目的是开展一些关于谈话的谈话来共同设计谈话，对目前的交流内容做出反馈，还有对下一步如何进行做出决定。一般来说，在谈话过程中至少有三次机会进入抽象层：
    1. 当你建立谈话的约定时
    2. 当你在谈话过程中进行检查时
    3. 当你总结谈话内容时。

At the very start of the conversation, you should spend a little time on making contact with the one(s) you are coaching. Establishing contact helps people relax and feel confident in speaking freely. This is small talk and chit chat, talking about the weather, the traffic, how’s-your-family, etc. Keep in mind that you should start steering towards starting the actual coaching conversation before too long.

在谈话刚刚开始的时候，你应该花点时间与你正在辅导的被教练者建立一些约定。建立约定可以帮助人们放松心情，并且对自由交谈感到自信。随便聊聊，讨论一下天气、交通状况、家庭等等。要记住的是，在正式转到实际的教练谈话之前不要耽搁太长时间。

### How you can establish the contract
### 如何建立约定

When you are establishing the contract, you invite the other part to talk about the conversation you are about to have. The contract consists of an agreement that you will have a coaching conversation, the ground rules for the conversation and the goal for the conversation. First of all, it should be clear for both parties that you are not just having a little chat. You are about to enter a serious conversation which might include both sensitive information and personal decisions. This expectation is sometimes implicit in the invitation, but it doesn’t hurt to make it explicit. If you are in a discussion already and realize that it might turn into a coaching conversation, you might ask “Is it OK if I ask you some questions to help you solve this problem?” You can also set up a later meeting in a similar way: “Should we sit down tomorrow and have a coaching conversation about this topic?"

当要建立约定的时候，你可以让其他人谈论一下你将要进行的谈话。约定包括双方对要进行一次教练谈话的共识，谈话的基本规则，还有谈话的目的。最重要的是，谈话双方必须清楚的认识到这不仅仅是一次闲聊，你们即将进入一段严肃的谈话，其中可能包括敏感信息和个人决定。有时候这种预期是隐含在邀请中的，但是明确的说明这一点并没有什么坏处。如果你已经处于讨论过程中，并且意识到这个讨论可能会演变成教练谈话时，你可以问一句：“我可以问你一些问题来帮助你解决这个问题吗？”你也可以用类似的方式约定一次后续的会议：“我们是不是应该明天一起坐下针对这个话题做一次教练谈话？”

You will also need to establish the ground rules of the coaching conversation. This normally includes a statement of confidentiality from your side as well as the promise of an “emergency exit” for the coachee or individual team members. For confidentiality, we typically use the simple and strict Vegas Rule that we described earlier, in sec. 3.1. However, if the team you are coaching is large and the atmosphere in the organization is sufficiently constructive, forgiving and supporting, you could also consider the Chatham House Rule4. It states that all participants are free to use any information, but are not allowed to reveal who made any comment.

你还需要为教练谈话建立一些基本的规则。这通常包括来自你这边的保密声明，以及对被教练者或者团队可以“紧急退出”的承诺。有关保密性，我们通常可以使用前面在3.1节中介绍的简单而严格的拉斯维加斯准则。但是，如果你正在辅导的团队比较大，组织氛围富有建设性、比较宽容、相互支持，你也可以考虑使用查塔姆豪斯规则。它规定所有的参与者都可以自由的使用任何信息，但是不允许透露是谁发表了评论。

In recurring meetings the rules quickly become implicit and you don’t need to repeat them, but when you are coaching someone for the first time you will have to explicitly set down the rules. We have a kind of boilerplate that we use that goes something like this:
  “Before we get started, I would like to make it clear that I will keep this conversation confidential. I may bring up general issues with others, but won’t talk about things that can be traced to you or to this discussion unless you give me permission. Also, you have the right to end the discussion and walk out if you feel like it, no questions asked. If at any point and for whatever reason you feel that you don’t want to be in this room anymore, just say so and we will stop right there.”

在常规会议中，规则很快变得自然而然，你也不需要特意重复，但是，当第一次辅导他人的时候，你需要明确的建立规则。我们可以使用这样的模板：

“在开始之前，我想说明一下，我会对这次谈话的内容保密。我可能会跟其他人谈到一些普遍的问题，但是，除非得到你的许可，我不会谈到那些可能会追溯到你或者这次讨论的内容。此外，如果你需要的话随时可以结束谈话，离开这间屋子，这都没有问题。在任何时间，由于任何原因，如果你觉得不想呆在这间屋子里面了，你都可以直接说出来，我们可以立刻停止。”

We find it good practice to have the counterpart formulate the goal of the conversation in one short sentence — and we usually also write it down in a notepad or on a sticky note. We usually ask questions like:
  • “What is the topic you want to elaborate and get insights on?”
  • “How can I best serve you during this conversation?”
  • “Are there questions you especially want me to ask or questions you absolutely do not want me to ask?”
  • “When this conversation is over, where do you expect to be and what do you hope to have learned?

我们发现，让对方用一句简短的话来描述谈话的目的是一种很好的做法 - 我们通常也会把它写在记事本或便签纸上。 我们通常会问如下问题：
+ 你想要阐述什么样的主题？表达什么样的见解？
+ 在这次谈话中，我怎样做才可以最好的帮到你？
+ 有哪些问题是你特别希望我问到，或者特别不希望我问到的？
+ 谈话结束后，你期望能够怎样，你希望能够学到什么？

Now the actual coaching conversation can begin. Start by picking out keywords from the goals you just agreed on and formulate a question or several questions from that.

现在，实际的教练谈话可以开始了。从你们刚刚达成共识的目标中挑选出一些关键词，并根据这些关键词提出一个或者一些问题。

## Having check-ups
## 进行检查

During the conversation, you should from time to time make a timeout to check-up on the conversation. Look at the clock and the timebox, summarize the learning so far and decide where to go next.

Check-ups help to co-design the conversation on the fly with the purpose of bringing the most possible value into it. Think of it as a sort of in-sprint inspect-and-adapt cycle on the meta level.

You can use check-ups when you feel the conversation is at a crossroads in which you have to decide which path to take next. Be humble and unbiased: do not take for granted that your personal decision will be the best path. Instead ask the one(s) you are coaching what they think and follow their choice. Remember: it is not about you! It is all about them! You can also use check-ups to re-negotiate the goal if you and the other person realize that another topic seems to be more important.

You can make as many check-ups as you feel necessary, asking questions like:
  •“Let me summarize the discussion so far. We have been discussing . . . and . . . , figuring out that . . . . Do you want to expand more on this, or would you rather move on and look at other options? What would that be?”
  • “Let’s look at where we are in this conversation. As I see it, we can either go in the direction of . . . or in the direction of . . . . You might see a third direction. Where do you want to go from here?”
  • “Let’s step out of the conversation and check how we are doing. In the beginning of this conversation we agreed to speak about . . . but it seems to me that we are now discussing . . . . What do you think, should we return to the original topic or is the new topic more important to you?

When the check-up is over you can continue the conversation taking into account the decisions you have just made together.

As an aside, we have found it useful to have a clock unobtrusively available. The simplest way is to put your wristwatch flat on the table beside your notepad. Smartwatches can be set to vibrate at certain points in time. Some smartphones can be configured to always show the time and there’s a plethora of timer apps. If all else fails, simply explain that you want to see how much time is left before you pull out your phone or watch.


Define the next steps, starting with a clear conclusion


By the end of the conversation, it is time to come to a conclusion focusing on the specific steps the coachee or team is going to do, in order to initiate the desired change. Have him, her or them summarize the conclusion instead of you doing it. That fosters the sense of responsibility. Remember: it is not your solution — it is their solution!

As a follow up to the conversation, it is great practice to ask about what the next step will be, when this will be done and how you will know that this has been achieved. To the last question the one(s) you coach will usually answer something like: “I’ll send you an e-mail, letting you know how it went”. In service to the other part, you could then reply: “And if I do not receive this mail, will it be helpful for you if I ask you about how it went?” This attitude sharpens the awareness about the coaching conversation as something that serves a purpose, rather than just being a chat about life, the universe and everything.

End by asking for feedback
Finally, being a coach that wants to improve your skills, you should also ask for feedback about the coaching conversation. You can ask questions like: “How was this conversation for you?”, “What did I do that was especially useful for you?” and “Which questions did I ask that were useless or disturbing for your understanding of the matter?”.

Receive the feedback with gratitude and ask clarifying questions if you wish, but do not go into arguing about whether the feedback was right or wrong. You are asking for opinions and everyone is entitled to their own. The important matter is how the coachee or team experienced your coaching — there is most likely a point behind the feedback regardless of whether you liked it or not.

Just like you opened the conversation, it can also be good to close down the conversation with chit chat and small talk as you collect your pens and papers and pack your bag. If you are meeting the coachee or the team again, you might also want to agree on the time and perhaps a topic or even an agenda for your next meeting.

Try this
1) Coaching conversations are best practiced in a live setup. We recommend that you start out by practicing with individuals and once you are comfortable with this, you can move on to coaching teams. This means finding someone who is willing to be coached by you, even though you may still be a novice.
Ideally the initial setup should be three persons: one who is coaching, one who is being coached (the coachee) and one who observes the conversation. This works very well if all three of you want to practice coaching. You can then take turns being the coach, the coachee and the observer. You can do 20-minute coaching conversations followed by five minutes of feedback from the observer, then take a five-minute break, switch roles and have a new coaching conversation. (Yes, as you probably already have figured out, the Pomodoro technique5 can be used for many purposes.)

2) If you can’t find an observer, then another option is to record the conversation and learn from it. You will of course need the permission of the coachee to record the conversation. Our experience tells us that while audio recordings are good, video recordings are much better for recall and understanding. Position the camera so that your upper body is in the frame, not the coachee. Make sure that the picture is wide enough for you to move around, but still shows your postures and facial expressions clearly.

Most modern pocket cameras or smartphones are more than adequate for this purpose, but you may want to record a minute of video beforehand to extrapolate whether there is enough memory available. Downscale the video to a lower quality in order to save space, as low-quality video is better than no video at all. A cheap tripod, a fast charger and a long charging cable will also be useful

3) Imagine a coaching conversation where you find it difficult to synchronize with the coachee. You can either think back to a previous coaching conversation that did not go as expected or think about an upcoming conversation with a person you are uncertain about. Now consider the communication enablers in sec. 3.4. Which ones were (or will be) especially relevant for the success of the conversation? Is there something related to the enablers that you could have done (or could now do) differently to improve the chances of success?
